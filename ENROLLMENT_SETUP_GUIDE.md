## 📋 Detailed Step-by-Step Setup

### **Step 1: Create Your Google Sheet (2 minutes)**

1. **Open Google Sheets**

   - Go to [sheets.google.com](https://sheets.google.com)
   - Make sure you're logged into your Google account

2. **Create New Spreadsheet**

   - Click the **"+ Blank"** button (big plus icon)
   - You'll see a new empty spreadsheet

3. **Rename Your Spreadsheet**

   - Click on **"Untitled spreadsheet"** at the top
   - Change it to **"TechAcademy Enrollments"**
   - Press Enter to save

4. **Don't Add Headers Yet**
   - Leave the spreadsheet empty
   - The script will automatically create headers when the first form is submitted

### **Step 2: Set Up Google Apps Script (5 minutes)**

**What is Google Apps Script?**

- It's like a mini-program that runs in the cloud
- It receives data from your website and puts it in the spreadsheet
- It's completely free and runs automatically

**Let's set it up:**

1. **Access Apps Script**

   - In your Google Sheet, look at the top menu
   - Click **Extensions** → **Apps Script**
   - A new tab will open with the Apps Script editor

2. **Prepare the Editor**

   - You'll see some default code that says `function myFunction() {}`
   - **Select all the code** (Ctrl+A or Cmd+A)
   - **Delete it** (press Delete key)
   - Now you have a blank editor

3. **Add the TechAcademy Code**

   - Open the `google-apps-script.js` file from your project
   - **Copy all the code** (Ctrl+A, then Ctrl+C)
   - **Paste it** into the Apps Script editor (Ctrl+V)

4. **Save Your Project**
   - Click the **Save** button (💾 icon) or press Ctrl+S
   - When prompted, name your project: **"TechAcademy Form Handler"**
   - Click **Save**

### **Step 3: Deploy as Web App (3 minutes)**

**What is deployment?**

- This makes your script accessible from the internet
- Your website will send data to this URL
- Google will run your script and save data to the sheet

**Deployment steps:**

1. **Start Deployment**

   - In the Apps Script editor, look for the **Deploy** button (top right)
   - Click **Deploy** → **New deployment**

2. **Configure Deployment Type**

   - You'll see a popup with deployment settings
   - Click the **gear icon** ⚙️ next to "Type"
   - Select **"Web app"** from the dropdown

3. **Set Deployment Details**

   - **Description**: Type "TechAcademy Enrollment Form Handler"
   - **Execute as**: Select **"Me (your-email@gmail.com)"**
   - **Who has access**: Select **"Anyone"** (this allows your website to send data)

4. **Deploy the Script**

   - Click the blue **Deploy** button
   - Google may ask for permissions - click **"Authorize access"**
   - If prompted, choose your Google account
   - Click **"Allow"** to grant permissions

5. **Copy Your Web App URL**
   - After deployment, you'll see a success message
   - **Copy the Web App URL** - it looks like:
   ```
   https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbx1234567890abcdef.../exec
   ```
   - **Save this URL** - you'll need it in the next step!

### **Step 4: Update Your Website Code (2 minutes)**

**Now we need to connect your website to the Google Sheet:**

1. **Open the Form Component**

   - Navigate to your project folder
   - Open `src/components/EnrollmentForm.jsx` in your code editor

2. **Find the Google Sheets Section**

   - Look for this line (around line 40):

   ```javascript
   // const response = await fetch(
   //   "https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_SCRIPT_ID/exec",
   ```

3. **Uncomment and Update the Code**

   - **Remove the `//` comments** from the Google Sheets section
   - **Add `//` comments** to the Formspree section to disable it
   - **Replace `YOUR_SCRIPT_ID`** with your actual script ID

   **Example:**

   ```javascript
   // Option 1: Google Sheets (ACTIVE)
   const response = await fetch(
     "https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbx1234567890abcdef.../exec",
     {
       method: "POST",
       mode: "no-cors",
       // ... rest of the code

   // Option 2: Formspree (DISABLED)
   // const response = await fetch("https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID", {
   ```

4. **Save the File**
   - Press Ctrl+S (or Cmd+S on Mac) to save
   - The website is now connected to your Google Sheet!

### **Step 5: Test the Setup (5 minutes)**

**Let's make sure everything works:**

1. **Deploy Your Website**

   - Commit your changes: `git add . && git commit -m "Connect to Google Sheets"`
   - Push to GitHub: `git push origin master`
   - Deploy to Vercel (it will auto-deploy from GitHub)

2. **Test the Form**

   - Go to your live website
   - Fill out the enrollment form with test data:
     - Name: "Test Student"
     - Email: "test@example.com"
     - Phone: "+91-9876543210"
     - Course: "Java Full Stack Developer"
     - Message: "This is a test submission"
   - Click "Get Free Counseling Session"

3. **Check Your Google Sheet**

   - Go back to your Google Sheet
   - **Refresh the page** (F5 or Ctrl+R)
   - You should see:
     - **Headers automatically created** in row 1
     - **Your test data** in row 2
     - **Professional formatting** applied

4. **What You Should See:**
   ```
   | Timestamp | Name | Email | Phone | Course | Message | Source | Status |
   |-----------|------|-------|-------|--------|---------|--------|--------|
   | 12/14/2024 3:30:00 PM | Test Student | test@example.com | +91-9876543210 | Java Full Stack Developer | This is a test submission | TechAcademy Website | New |
